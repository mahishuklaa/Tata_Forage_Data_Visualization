# Tata_Forage_Virtual_Internship

I recently completed Tata Group's Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights Job Simulation on Forage!

I’m incredibly grateful to Tata Group and Forage for providing this opportunity to engage myself in a hands-on simulation that placed me in the role of a Data Analyst at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).

The goal was to support the CEO and CMO with data-driven insights that directly impact decision-making around expansion strategy and customer retention.

Here’s what I did to achieve this goal:

## 1. Framing the Business Scenario
Firstly, I stepped into the mindset of the CEO and CMO. I drafted strategic questions for each, focusing on forecasting and growth for the CEO, and customer segmentation and market targeting for the CMO.

## 2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Then, I worked with a real-world online retail dataset and ensured quality by filtering out invalid records. I excluded negative quantities (indicating returns) and incorrect unit prices (< $0).

## 3. Choosing the Right Visuals
Using data storytelling frameworks like the Grammar of Graphics, I selected the charts that were ideal for each business question.

## 4. Creating Effective Visuals in Power BI
I built a four-tab interactive dashboard in Power BI covering:
• Monthly revenue trends (to detect seasonality for forecasting)
• Top countries by revenue and quantity sold (for market targeting)
• Top 10 customers by revenue (supporting retention strategies)
• Global product demand map (highlighting high-potential expansion regions)

## 5. Communicating Insights to Leadership
Then, I finally designed and presented a strategic recommendation deck customized for executive leadership.

This simulation taught me how to think like a consultant solving real business problems and turn messy data into actionable insights.
I learned how to use tools like Power BI to support executive-level storytelling and balance business acumen with technical analysis.
